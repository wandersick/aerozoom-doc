
                     [ AeroZoom 3.1 with AeroSnip ]
  
     a smooth Mac-zoom, keyboard-free presentation/HTPC assistive tool

       
  #  AeroZoom enhances upon the smooth Magnifier in Windows 7 to magnify
     like a Mac does, as well as turning any mouse into an expensive
     presentation mouse, where wheel-zooming and positioning becomes a
     breeze without a keyboard.

  #  Version 3 features AeroSnip (enhances and streamline Snipping Tool),
     Elastic Zoom, ZoomIt Panel, Custom Hotkeys, partial support for
     Windows 7 Standard User account with UAC, Vista and XP.

     [ The AeroZoom Panel ]
	 
  #  Bind keyboard controls commonly used in presentations to buttons of
     mouse and 'AeroZoom Panel' accessible by clicking [Left]+[Right].
  
  #  AeroZoom Panel is made of large buttons designed to quickly toggle 
     sub-magnifier settings or to add more functionality. Upon calling
     it by mouse, it pops up where the cursor is, without the need of
     locating the Magnifier window minimized in taskbar.
        
     [ AeroSnip Screen Clipper - needs Snipping Tool in Vista/7 ]

  #  Whereas AeroZoom improves Windows Magnifier, AeroSnip enhances
     Snipping Tool giving a Mac/Linux screen-capturing experience on Win

     - Switch to AeroSnip Slider on AeroZoom Panel that quickly switches
       between free-form, rectangular, window and full-screen snips.

     - Each snipping mode (free, rectangular, window, full screen) has
       their own hotkeys ¡V Win+Alt+F, Win+Alt+R, Win+Alt+W, Win+Alt+S.

     - After snipping or pressing Print Screen, open the image with an
       external editor such as Paint, other than Snipping Tool's editor.

     - Automatically save Snipping Tool and Print Screen captures in any
       location (default: desktop) as well as clipboard.

     - Streamlined procedires of starting a new snip--just use hotkeys
       or Snip button anytime a new snip is wanted, no more locating-an
       existing-Snipping-Tool-window-from-taskbar to click ¡¥New¡¦.

     - Press and hold Middle button for half a second to start a snip
       of the type currently selected on the AeroSnip Slider. (Button,
       delay and the action can be customized ¡V see 'Custom Hotkeys'.)
  
     [ ZoomIt Panel - requires Sysinternals ZoomIt, XP/Vista/7 ]

  #  Switching to ZoomIt Panel improves mouse operation of Sysinternals
     ZoomIt by adding a friendly interface, elastic/wheel-zoom and more

     - Wheel-zoom support (Wheel-zoom can be achieved partially under
       XP and Vista now thanks to ZoomIt supporting those systems)

     - Friendly user interface (ZoomIt Panel) to access functions that
       normally required keyboard shortcuts, utilizing functions such
       as the pen-color slider, white/black board.

     - Customize mouse hotkeys to achieve keyboard-less presentation

     - A handy list of ZoomIt keyboard shortcuts

     - Elastic Zoom, live or still. (See following)
  
     [ Elastic Zoom - requires Windows 7 Magnifier or ZoomIt ]

  #  Automatically zoom in and out by holding and releasing same hotkey

     - Elastic Zoom allows us to zoom in then zoom out just by holding
       and releasing the same hotkey [Ctrl]+[Caps Lock], simplifying
       the zoom procedure. (Replace with [Shift] for still zoom.)

              This list of hotkeys are for Windows 7 admin accounts.
              In other cases, go to '? > Quick Instructions' for the
              correct list. Hotkeys will be fewer on older systems.
       
     [ Special Installation ] 
  
  #  AeroZoom by default installs into Local App Data, To install to
     All Users or perform unattended installation, see Setup.exe /?

     Unless installing to Program Files, the installation is per-user 
     and does not require admin rights.
  
     [ Usage and Tips ]
  
  #  Be sure to read the tips and tricks from the 'Startup Tips'.
     Also, see this page for a walkthrough and video:
  
     wandersick.blogspot.com/p/aerozoom-for-windows-7-magnifier.html
  
     [ System Requirements ]

  #  AeroZoom 3 does not need administrator rights to run anymore.
     (But the experience is better in some cases if available.)
  
  1. Runs best on Windows 7 Home Premium/Professional/Ultimate/Ent.
     Also supports Vista and XP. (some functions will be limited.)
       
  2. Aero (theme) is a must. Windows 7 Starter/Home Basic cannot
     enable Aero at all, so Lens and Full Screen zoom cannot be used.
     In such cases, we can check 'Tool > Wheel-Zoom by ZoomIt' so
     that AeroZoom adds Wheel-Zoom support to Sysinternals ZoomIt.

     [ Compatibility ]

  1. Windows Media Center users may have an issue where the cursor
     is missing in full screen. It is a Windows bug between WMC and
     Magnifier. You may work around it by clicking the Kill button 
     on panel or use this hotkey to kill magnifier: Win+Shift+K, or
     re-define the middle button action as 'Kill'. To do that, go 
     to 'Tool > Preferences > Custom Hotkeys > Holding Middle' and 
     set its action to 'Kill'.

  2. WizMouse is only semi-compatible with AutoHotkey--the language
     AeroZoom is based on. From a WizMouse doc: "Some users
     reported that rehooking may cause issues with AutoHotkey so
     now it can be disabled. Note that AutoHotkey (Add: AeroZoom)
     must be started AFTER WizMouse for them to work together
     correctly."
	 
     Tip: Clicking on any of the Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Left/Right/Middle/
     F/B radio buttons on the AeroZoom Panel restarts AeroZoom.
	 
     If the above doesn't help and you must use AeroZoom with
     WizMouse, the only way is go to WizMouse's Settings and check
     'Left click tray icon to enable/disable', so that left-
     clicking WizMouse's tray icon quickly disables WizMouse and
     enables AeroZoom, or vice versa.
	 
  3. Multi-monitor configurations should work okay with AeroZoom.
     In rare cases where AeroZoom Panel does not show up near the
     cursor, adjust offset of panel manually in 'Tool > Preferences
     > Advanced Options'.

     [ Limitations ]
  
  #  If you've encountered any bugs or any of the following but 
     think it is a bug. Please email wandersick@gmail.com
  
  1. Misclick-Preventing Pad may be inaccurate for some types of
     window. You may fine-tune the offset in 'Tool > Preferences
     > Advanced Options'.
  
  2. Zooming may be jerky when both misclick-preventing pad and 
     'Follow keyboard' are on. (Use 'Follow text' as a workaround.)
  
  3. Turning ZoomIt on and off (via 'Tool > Enable ZoomIt') too
     often may leave lots of phantom tray icons.
  
  4. The Magnification slider gets jerky or does not work in rare
     situations. A workaround to restore it to normal is to use
     keyboard shortcut (Win+[+]) to zoom in once.
    
  5. 'Run on Startup' fails to automatically run magnifier at
     startup if there are UAC prompts caused by other programs
     during boot.

  6. During use of AeroZoom, Magnifier cannot be run separately.
     This is normal as AeroZoom hides Magnifier to improve UX. To
     show it anytime, just click [Mag] from AeroZoom Panel (eq to
     Win+Shift+`). If always showing is preferred, go to 'Tool >
     Preferences > Advanced Options', change 'Magnifier' to 'Show'
  
  7. Pressing buttons on the AeroZoom Panel has no effect at times?
     You may have to set 'Operation delay' in 'Tool > Preferences
     > Advanced Options' to a higher value for your system.

     [ Bugs Fixed in This Release ]
       
  #  Snipping with middle button no longer leaves a mark in captures

  #  Negative offset values can be set in Advanced Option

  #  'Run on Startup' in zh-CN systems (in fact, a schtasks bug)
