
                     [ AeroZoom 3.0 with AeroSnip ]
  
       The smooth wheel-zoom, keyboard-free presentation/HTPC tool

       
  #  AeroZoom enhances upon the new smooth-zooming Magnifier in Windows
     7 to simulate a presentation mouse, where zooming in/out and 
     positioning is a breeze without a keyboard.

  #  Version 3 features AeroSnip (Snipping Tool enhancer), ZoomIt Panel,
     Elastic Zoom, custom hotkey, Win7 Standard User, Vista, XP support.

  #  Free for home and commercial use. GPL. Written with AutoHotkey.

     [ Original Features ]
       
  #  Bind keyboard controls commonly used in presentations to mouse 
     buttons and 'AeroZoom Panel' buttons.
  
  #  AeroZoom Panel is made of large buttons designed to quickly toggle 
     sub-magnifier settings or to add more functionality. Upon calling
     by mouse buttons, it pops up where the cursor is, without the need
     to locate the Magnifier window minimized in taskbar.
        
     [ About AeroSnip ]

  #  AeroSnip gives a Mac/Linux screen-capturing experience on Windows:

     - AeroSnip Slider on AeroZoom Panel quickly switches between free-
       form, rectangular, window and full-screen snips.

     - Each snipping mode (free, rectangular, window, full screen) has
       their own hotkeys ¡V Win+Alt+F, Win+Alt+R, Win+Alt+W, Win+Alt+S.

     - After capturing, open the image with an external editor such as
       Paint, other than Snipping Tool's own editor.

     - Automatically save captures on disk anywhere we want (desktop by
       default) as well as clipboard. (Thanks to NirCmd)

     - Simplified procedure of starting a new snip ¡V just use the hotkey
       or Snip button anytime a new snip is wanted, no more locating an
       existing Snipping Tool window from taskbar to click ¡¥New¡¦.

     - Press and hold Middle button for half a second to start a snip
       of the type currently selected on the AeroSnip Slider. (Button,
       delay and the action can be customized ¡V see 'Custom Hotkeys'.)

     - Same enhancements to the [Alt] Print Screen button

  #  Whereas AeroZoom enhances Windows Magnifier, AeroSnip enhances
     Snipping Tool. They were separate tools before but now combined
     as one software, hence AeroZoom 3 = AeroZoom 2.0 + AeroSnip 1.0
  
     [ v3 Features ]

  #  ZoomIt Panel makes Sysinternals ZoomIt more powerful, easier to Use

     - Wheel-zoom support (Yes, wheel-zoom can be achieved partially
       under XP and Vista now thanks to ZoomIt supporting those systems)

     - Friendly user interface (ZoomIt Panel) to access functions that
       normally required keyboard shortcuts

     - Expose useful hidden functions and use them fast, such as slider
       to change pen color, buttons to use white board and black board.

     - Customizable mouse hotkeys for the main and hidden functions to
       achieve presentation without a keyboard (See 'Custom Hotkeys')

     - Show a complete list of ZoomIt keyboard shortcuts by clicking
       ¡¥Help¡¦ on ZoomIt Panel.

     - Elastic Zoom, live or still. (See next)

  #  Elastic Zoom  ¡V  hold to zoom in, release to zoom out. Fast!

     - Elastic Zoom allows us to zoom in at something and immediately
       zoom out just by holding and releasing the same button,
       simplifying the zoom procedure to one press of hotkey!

     - To zoom in ¡¥elastically¡¦, just hold Ctrl then hit CapsLock once
       for live zoom, or hold Shift then hit CapsLock once for still
       zoom (the latter requires Sysinternals ZoomIt). And when done,
       just release the Ctrl/Shift buttons to zoom out.

  #  Custom Hotkeys  ¡V  30+ mouse-utilizing hotkeys and functions

     - Functions: All AZ tools, speak, google, eject, turn off LCD...

     - Location: Tool > Preferences > Custom Hotkeys

  #  Configuration import and export (auto-backup on exit)

  #  Workaround for Windows Media Center (See [Compatibility] below).

              This list of hotkeys are for Windows 7 admin accounts.
              In other cases, go to '? > Quick Instructions' for the
              correct list. Hotkeys will be fewer on older systems.
       
     [ Special Installation ] 
  
  #  AeroZoom by default installs into Local App Data, To install to
     All Users or perform unattended installation, see Setup.exe /?

     Unless installing to Program Files, the installation is per-user 
     and does not require admin rights.
  
     [ Usage and Tips ]
  
  #  Be sure to read the tips and tricks from the Startup Tips feature.
     Also, see this page for a walkthrough and video:
  
     wandersick.blogspot.com/p/aerozoom-for-windows-7-magnifier.html
  
     [ System Requirements ]

  #  AeroZoom 3 does not need administrator rights to run anymore.
     (But the experience is better if available.)
  
  1. Runs best on Windows 7 Home Premium/Professional/Ultimate/Ent.
     Also supports Vista and XP. (some functions will be limited.)
       
  2. Aero (theme) is a must. Windows 7 Starter/Home Basic cannot
     enable Aero at all, so Lens and Full Screen zoom cannot be used.
     In such cases, we can check 'Tool > Wheel-Zoom by ZoomIt' so
     that AeroZoom adds Wheel-Zoom support to Sysinternals ZoomIt.

     [ Compatibility ]

  1. Windows Media Center users may face an issue where the cursor
     is missing in full screen. It is a Windows bug between WMC and
     Magnifier. You may work around it by clicking the Kill button 
     on panel or use this hotkey to kill magnifier: Win+Shift+K, or
     re-define the middle button action. To do that, go to 'Tool >
     Preferences > Custom Hotkeys > Holding Middle' and set its
     action to 'Kill'.

  2. WizMouse is incompatible with AeroZoom. If you use AeroZoom
     with WizMouse, go to WizMouse's Settings and check 'Left click
     tray icon to enable/disable', so that left-clicking WizMouse's
     tray icon easily disables WizMouse and enables AeroZoom, or
     vice versa.

  3. Multi-monitor configurations should work okay with AeroZoom.
     In rare cases where AeroZoom Panel does not show up near the
     cursor, adjust offset of panel manually in 'Tool > Preferences
     > Advanced Options'.

     [ Limitations ]
  
  #  If you've encountered any bugs or any of the following and 
     think it is a bug. Please email Wandersick@gmail.com
  
  1. Misclick-Preventing Pad may be inaccurate for some types of
     window. You may fine-tune the offset in 'Tool > Preferences
     > Advanced Options'.
  
  2. Zooming may be jerky when both misclick-preventing pad and 
     'Follow keyboard' are on. (Use 'Follow text' as a workaround.)
  
  3. Turning ZoomIt on and off (via 'Tool > Enable ZoomIt') too
     often may leave lots of phantom tray icons.
  
  4. The Magnification slider gets jerky or does not work in rare
     situations. A workaround to restore it to normal is to use
     keyboard shortcut (Win+[+]) to zoom in once.
    
  5. 'Run on Startup' fails to automatically run magnifier at
     startup if there are UAC prompts caused by other programs
     during boot.

  6. During use of AeroZoom, Magnifier cannot be run separately.
     This is normal as AeroZoom hides Magnifier to improve UX. To
     show it anytime, just click [Mag] from AeroZoom Panel (eq to
     Win+Shift+`). If always showing is preferred, go to 'Tool >
     Preferences > Advanced Options', change 'Magnifier' to 'Show'
  
  7. Pressing buttons on the AeroZoom Panel has no effect at times?
     You may have to set 'Operation delay' in 'Tool > Preferences
     > Advanced Options' to a higher value for your system.

     [ Fixed Bugs ]
       
  #  Snipping with middle button no longer creates a mark

  #  Negative offset values can be set in Advanced Option

  #  'Run on Startup' (schtasks) bug in zh-CN systems
