  
                              [ AeroZoom 2.0a ]
  
          The smooth wheel-zoom, keyboard-free presentation tool

       
  #  AeroZoom enhances upon the new smooth-zooming Magnifier in Windows
     7 to simulate a presentation mouse, where zooming in/out and 
     positioning is a breeze without a keyboard.
  
  #  Enhances mouse operations of Snipping Tool and ZoomIt too since v2.
  
     [ Main Features ]
       
  #  Binding keyboard controls commonly used in presentations to mouse 
     buttons and 'AeroZoom panel' buttons.
  
  #  Zooming in/out or reset any time without using a keyboard; handle 
     more operations with one hand.
  
  #  AeroZoom panel is made of large buttons designed to quickly toggle 
     sub-magnifier settings or to add more functionality. Upon calling
     by mouse buttons, it pops up where the cursor is, without the need
     to locate the Magnifier window minimized in taskbar.
        
     [ New Features ]
  
  #  Mac OS X zoom -- Achieved with modifier key support: Ctrl, Alt, 
     Win, Shift. Added more mouse button support: Middle, Back, Forward
     and Left, Right. (Lefthanders don't need to run a separate program
     anymore.)
  
  #  'Single-finger zoom' -- No need to use 2 buttons to zoom anymore. 
     Simply zoom by holding and pressing the middle button. 
  
  #  Powerpointing while zooming live -- Thanks to AeroZoom Pad (aka 
     Misclick-preventing pad) that prevents sending clicks to apps
     behind.
  
  #  Sliders -- Slide it to zoom in/out or adjust how deep each scroll 
     zooms (Or, watch it indicate changes as hotkeys are being used to
     zoom.)
  
  #  Hold Middle mouse button as trigger -- Do more with a mouse, and
     dynamically switching operations between zoomed/unzoomed states.
  
     -  While zoomed, quickly preview the whole screen and move to 
        other areas without zooming out.
  
     -  Capture regions of screen for annotation with Snipping Tool --
        By holding Middle button and drag. (Like Compiz's Winkey+drag.)
  
     -  Optional Sysinternals ZoomIt enhancements -- Access non-live 
        zoom (aka still zoom), draw, break timer, black/white board,
        all without a keyboard.
  
     [ More Features ]
  
  #  New Tool menu containing lots of useful accessories, such as:
  
     -  Windows Tools: Access common tools right from the menu.
  
     -  Run on Startup: e.g. Have the screen color inverted at startup
  
     -  Click-n-Go: In old versions, when a panel button is pressed, 
        AeroZoom Panel hides itself at once for efficiency, but now
        this feature is optional to help beginners.
  
     -  Always-on-Top: Make panel and tools run from it on the front.
  
     -  Advanced Options: Lots of customizations for tweakers, e.g.
        define a custom text editor, delay the triggers.
  
  #  All Windows Magnifier settings can now be accessed in the panel.
  
  #  Specially optimize mouse with a Back/Forward button to do more.
     (See '? > Quick Instructions > Extras')
  
  #  Supports more keyboard shortcuts (See [Quick Instructions] below)
  
  #  Many subtle improvements, e.g. redesigned algorithm to enhance
     precision and performance. Magnifier runs in the background at
     once after AeroZoom is started. Settings from last time are also
     applied automatically.
  
  #  Portable and now installable. (See [Special Installation] below.)
  
  #  Native 64-bit support.
  
  #  As always, free and open source. Written with AutoHotkey.
  
     [ Quick Start ]
   
  #  Basically, just run AeroZoom.exe. Try zooming with [Left]+[Wheel-
     up/down] mouse buttons, preview full screen by holding [Middle],
     reset zoom with [Left]+[Middle]. (The latter are added functions
     which the original Magnifier does not offer.) Then, when more
     functions are needed, call the AeroZoom panel with [Left]+[Right]
     buttons.
  
     [ Quick Instructions ]
  
  #  AeroZoom binds common keyboard controls to these mouse buttons
     and keys.

     [ Special Installation ] 
  
  #  AeroZoom by default installs into Local App Data, To install to
     All Users or perform unattended installation, see Setup.exe /?
  
     [ Usage and Tips ]
  
  #  There's a lot I want to tell you, so I did a Startup Tips feature
     in AeroZoom 2.0. Also, see this page for a walkthrough and video:
  
     wandersick.blogspot.com/p/aerozoom-for-windows-7-magnifier.html
  
     [ System Requirements ]
  
    1. Windows 7 Home Basic/Home Premium/Professional/Ultimate/Enterp.
       
    2. Aero (theme) is required. Windows 7 Starter does not support 
       Aero at all, so it cannot use Lens and Full Screen views.
  
    3. AeroZoom needs administrator rights to run. If non-admin, it
       elevates itself. (Note: However, the Installation is per-user 
       and does not require admin rights). 'Run on Startup' and some
       parts don't fully support standard user accounts (even after
       elevation).
  
    4. For Sysinternals ZoomIt enhancements, please download zoomit
       .exe and put it into 'AeroZoom\Data' folder.
  
     [ Limitations ]
  
    #  If you've encountered any bugs or any of the following and 
       think it is a bug. Please leave a message via the link above
       to let Wandersick know.
  
    1. Sometimes, the 1st click (holding [Middle] button) for still 
       zoom (of Sysinternals ZoomIt) has no effect. The 2nd time does.
  
    2. In middle button modifier, scrolling too 'awkwardly' may cause 
       duplication ('ghost frames') of misclick-preventing pad.
  
    3. Zoom Pad may be inaccurate for some types of window. You may 
       try fine-tuning offset settings in 'Tool > Advanced Options'.
  
    4. Zooming may be jerky when both misclick-preventing pad and 
       'follow keyboard' are on. ('Follow text' is OK though.)
  
    5. Turning ZoomIt on and off frequenly may leave lots of phantom
       tray icons.
  
    6. In unknown situations, the pad suddenly turns untransparent.
  
    7. The Magnification slider gets jerky or does not work. Try to
       avoid using keyboard hotkeys and see if it improves.
  
    8. Tip for ZoomIt's Zoom/Draw/Timer. While a ZoomIt window is 
       activated, do NOT press [Alt + F4] to leave; otherwise ZoomIt
       .exe might hang without ending the process, leaving a phantom
       ZoomIt.exe that causes problems. Instead, press [Esc] or right
       click or press [Timer] on the panel to leave.
  
    9. 'Run on Startup' fails to automatically run magnifier at
       startup if there are UAC prompts caused by other programs
       during boot.
  
   10. After using AeroZoom, Magnifier cannot be launched separately.
       Solution: At 'Tool > Advanced Options', change 'Magnifier' to
       Min/Show.
  
   11. Pressing buttons on the AeroZoom panel has no effect at times?
       You may have to set 'Button delay' in 'Tool > Advanced Options'
       to a higher value for your system. (Some tweaking is required.)
