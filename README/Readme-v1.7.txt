     [ What? ]

  #  AeroZoom is a simple AutoHotKey program that enhances upon the new 
     Magnifier in Windows 7 to turn any mouse into a presentation mouse, where
     zooming in/out and moving around becomes a breeze without a keyboard.
     
     [ Features ]
     
  #  Binding keyboard controls commonly used in presentations to mouse buttons
     and 'AeroZoom panel' buttons.

  #  Zooming in/out or reset any time without using a keyboard; handle more
     operations with one hand.

  #  AeroZoom panel is made of large buttons designed to quickly toggle sub-
     magnifier settings (It only needs 1 click while Magnifier needs 3 for
     those settings.) or to add more functionalities (Show, Kill, Reset, Draw,
     Type and Calc). Upon calling by mouse buttons, it pops up where the cursor
     is, without the need to locate the Magnifier window minimized in taskbar.
  
  #  [Show], [Kill] and [Reset] buttons restore a hidden Magnifier, stop the
     magnifier process and apply default settings; [Draw], [Type] and [Calc]
     buttons run Snipping Tool, Wordpad and Calculator respectively.

  #  Comes with an alternative executable for lefthanders.

  #  Portable. Writes per-user settings to registry.
  
  #  Open source. Written with AutoHotKey. Exe and ahk flavours are available
     for download separately.
     
  #  Works better with a wireless mouse.
  
  #  Fast and smooth thanks to Windows 7 having greatly improved its Magnifier
     (Being an enhancement to the new Magnifier, it requires a system newer
     than XP and Vista)

     [ Instructions ]

  #  AeroZoom binds common keyboard controls to these mouse buttons.

     AeroZoom panel 	=> [Left] + [Right]
     Show magnifier 	=> [Left] + [Wheel-up]
     Reset zoom    		=> [Left] + [Middle]
     Zoom in  	  		=> hold [Left] + [Wheel-up]
     Zoom out 	  		=> hold [Left] + [Wheel-down]

  #  Lefthanders please run the Lefthanded version and reverse the above
     [Left] mouse buttons with [Right] ones and vice versa.
     
     [ So... how to use it? ]
     
  #  Basically, just run AutoHotKey.exe (or .ahk if you have AutoHotKey
     installed), and try zooming with [Left]+[Wheel-up/down] mouse buttons,
     reset zoom with [Left]+[Middle] buttons. (The latter is an added function
     which the original Magnifier does not offer.) Then, when more functions
     are needed, call the AeroZoom panel with [Left]+[Right] buttons.
     
     [ Usage and Tips ]

  1. If I suddenly want to change a setting in Magnifier, such as to make it
     follow keyboard inputs automatically. Instead of finding the Magnifier
     window that may be hidden deep in the taskbar, I can simply launch the
     'AeroZoom panel' by mouse buttons [Left]+[Right] and click on the big
     'Keyboard' button to toggle the setting.
     
     If I've messed up any settings, e.g. screen color is inverted, as well as
     locked and zoomed in, I want to correct it but sadly, Magnifier is
	   minimized and out of sight. What I'll do is launch the panel quickly by
	   mouse buttons which always follows my curzor so that I can fix the settings
	   there.
     
     If in emergency, click the 'Kill' button there to shut down Magnifier or
	   'Reset' button to restore default settings and zoom level.
	 
	   Even more quickly, click [Left]+[Middle] to reset zoom immediately even 
	   without the panel, although it doesn't restore other settings.

  2. 'Show' button can also be used to restore a Magnifier hidden in the
     taskbar as well as starting it.

     The fastest way however to start Magnifier is just to wheel up.
  
     Be careful though if you wheel up too far, "Ease of Access Center" may be
     brought up accidentally. The trick is not to wheel up too far at teh start
     (You can wheel however you want to zoom in/out later after starting.)
     
  3. If drawing on screen is desired, click [Draw] which launches the new
     Snipping Tool in Windows 7 where users can take a picture of the screen
     and draw on it. Similarly, click [Type] to launch Wordpad (where pictures
     from Snipping Tool can be pasted too); click [Calc] to launch Calculator.
     
  4. There are times when AeroZoom's mouse button mapping causes inconvenience
     with your application. To solve this, there's no need to exit AeroZoom;
     just click the [off] button on the lower left corner of the panel to
     temporarily pause the mapping. To resume, click it again.
     
     To minimize AeroZoom to tray, simply close it or click [hide] button on
     the panel; to exit, click [quit].
     
  5. AeroZoom requires administrator rights. If non-admin, it elevates itself.
