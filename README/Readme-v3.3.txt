

                     [ AeroZoom 3.3 with AeroSnip ]
  
        The smooth wheel-zooming and snipping mouse-enhancing panel

  
  #  AeroZoom enhances upon the smooth Magnifier in Windows 7 to magnify
     as Apple Mac OS does, as well as turning any mouse into a HTPC/
     presentation mouse, where wheel-zooming and positioning becomes
     a breeze without a keyboard.

  #  Version 3 features AeroSnip (enhanced Snipping Tool), Elastic Zoom,
     ZoomIt Panel, Custom Hotkeys, support for Windows 7 Standard User
     accounts w/o UAC, or partially with UAC, Vista and XP.

  #  See bottom for what's updated in latest version 3.3.


     [ AeroZoom Panel ]
	 
  #  Bind keyboard controls commonly used in presentations to buttons of
     mouse and 'AeroZoom Panel' accessible by clicking [Left]+[Right].
  
  #  AeroZoom Panel is made of large buttons designed to quickly toggle 
     sub-magnifier settings or to add more functions. Upon calling with
     mouse, it pops up where the cursor is, without the need of locating
     the Magnifier window minimized in taskbar.
        

     [ AeroSnip - enhances Snipping Tool on Vista/7 ]

  #  Whereas AeroZoom improves Windows Magnifier, AeroSnip enhances
     Snipping Tool giving a Mac/Linux screen-capturing experience on Win

     - Switch to AeroSnip Slider on AeroZoom Panel that quickly switches
       between free-form, rectangular, window and full-screen snips.

     - Each snipping mode (free, rectangular, window, full screen) has
       their own hotkeys ¡V Win+Alt+F, Win+Alt+R, Win+Alt+W, Win+Alt+S.

     - After snipping or pressing Print Screen, open the image with an
       external editor such as Paint, other than Snipping Tool's editor.

     - Automatically save Snipping Tool and Print Screen captures in any
       location (default: desktop) as well as clipboard.

     - Press and hold Middle button for half a second to start a snip
       of the type currently selected on the AeroSnip Slider. (Button,
       delay and the action can be customized ¡V see 'Custom Hotkeys'.)

     - Streamlined procedures of starting a new snip--just use hotkeys
       or Snip button anytime a new snip is wanted, no more locating-an
       existing-Snipping-Tool-window-from-taskbar to click ¡¥New¡¦ for a
       new capture.
  

     [ ZoomIt Panel - enhances Sysinternals ZoomIt on XP/Vista/7 ]

  #  Switching to ZoomIt Panel improves mouse operation of Sysinternals
     ZoomIt by adding an interface, elastic/wheel-zoom and more

     - Wheel-zoom support (Wheel-zoom can be achieved partially under
       XP and Vista now thanks to ZoomIt supporting those systems)

     - Friendly user interface (ZoomIt Panel) to access functions that
       normally required keyboard shortcuts, utilizing functions such
       as the pen-color slider, white/black board.

     - Customize mouse hotkeys to achieve keyboard-less presentation

     - A handy list of ZoomIt keyboard shortcuts at hand.

     - Elastic Zoom, live or still. (See following)
  

     [ Elastic Zoom - enhances Windows 7 Magnifier or ZoomIt ]

  #  Automatically zoom in and out by holding and releasing same hotkey

     - Elastic Zoom allows zooming in and out just by holding and
       releasing the same hotkey [Ctrl]+[Caps Lock], simplifying the
       whole zoom procedure.

              This list of hotkeys are for Windows 7 admin accounts.
              In other cases, go to '? > Quick Instructions' for the
              correct list. Hotkeys will be fewer on older systems.
       

     [ Special Installation ] 
  
  #  AeroZoom by default installs into Local App Data, To install to
     All Users or perform unattended installation, see Setup.exe /?

     Unless installing to Program Files, the installation is per-user 
     and does not require admin rights.
  

     [ Usage and Tips ]
  
  #  Be sure to read the tips and tricks from the 'Startup Tips'.
     Also, see this page for a walkthrough and video:
  
     wandersick.blogspot.com/p/aerozoom-for-windows-7-magnifier.html
  

     [ System Requirements ]

  #  AeroZoom 3 does not need administrator rights to run anymore.
     (But the experience is better in some cases if available.)
  
  1. Runs best on Windows 7 Home Premium/Professional/Ultimate/Ent.
     Also supports Vista and XP. (some functions will be limited.)
       
  2. Aero (theme) is a must. Windows 7 Starter/Home Basic cannot
     enable Aero at all, so Lens and Full Screen zoom cannot be used.
     In such cases, we can check 'Tool > Wheel-Zoom by ZoomIt' so
     that AeroZoom applies its wheel-Zoom support on Sysinternals
     ZoomIt.

  3. Windows 8 beta support has been added unofficially since v3.3.

     [ Compatibility ]

  1. Windows Media Center users may face an issue where the cursor
     is missing in full screen. It is a Windows bug between WMC and
     Magnifier. Users may work around it by clicking 'Kill' on the
     panel or use the default hotkey to kill magnifier: Win+Shift+K,
     or redefine the middle button action as 'Kill'. To do that, go 
     to 'Tool > Custom Hotkeys > Settings > Holding Middle' and 
     set its action to 'Kill'.

  2. WizMouse is only semi-compatible with AutoHotkey--the language
     AeroZoom is based on. From the WizMouse doc: "Some users
     reported that rehooking may cause issues with AutoHotkey so
     now it can be disabled. Note that AutoHotkey (Add: AeroZoom)
     must be started AFTER WizMouse for them to work together
     correctly."
	 
     Tip 1: Clicking on any Ctrl/Shift/Alt/Left/Right/Middle/F/B
     button on the AeroZoom Panel restarts (brings back) AeroZoom.

     Tip 2: (Since v3.2) Clicking the tray icon 3 times does it too.
	 
     Tip 3: Go to WizMouse's Settings and check 'Left click tray
     icon to enable/disable', so that left-clicking WizMouse's tray
     icon quickly disables WizMouse and enables AeroZoom, or vice
     versa.
	 
  3. Multi-monitor configurations should work okay with AeroZoom.
     In rare cases where AeroZoom Panel does not show up near the
     cursor, adjust panel offset manually in 'Tool > Preferences
     > Advanced Options'.


     [ Limitations ]
  
  #  If you've encountered any bugs or any of the following limits 
     but think it is a bug. Please email wandersick@gmail.com
  
  1. Misclick-Preventing Pad may be inaccurate for some types of
     window. You may fine-tune the offset in 'Tool > Preferences
     > Advanced Options'.
  
  2. Zooming may be jerky when both misclick-preventing pad and 
     'Follow keyboard' are on. (Use 'Follow text' as a workaround.)
  
  3. Turning ZoomIt on and off (via 'Tool > Enable ZoomIt') too
     often may leave lots of phantom tray icons.
  
  4. The Magnification slider gets jerky or does not work in rare
     situations. A workaround to restore it to normal is to use
     keyboard shortcut (Win+[+]) to zoom in once.
    
  5. 'Run on Startup' fails to automatically run magnifier at
     startup if there are UAC prompts caused by other programs
     during boot.

  6. During use of AeroZoom, Magnifier cannot be run separately.
     This is normal as AeroZoom hides Magnifier to improve UX. To
     show it anytime, just click [Mag] from AeroZoom Panel (eq to
     Win+Shift+`). If always showing is preferred, go to 'Tool >
     Preferences > Advanced Options', change 'Magnifier' to 'Show'
  
  7. Pressing buttons on the AeroZoom Panel has no effect at times?
     You may have to set 'Operation delay' in 'Tool > Preferences
     > Advanced Options' to a higher value for your system.
